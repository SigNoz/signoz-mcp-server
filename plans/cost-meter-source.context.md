## Key Decisions & Discussion Log

### 2026-06-02 — Implementation approach

- `source` is already a first-class concept in the codebase (`signoz_list_metrics`, `signoz_get_field_keys`, `signoz_get_field_values` all carry it). Extending it to query tools is consistent.
- `signoz_execute_builder_query` takes the full query payload as a structured object. Adding `Source string json:"source,omitempty"` to `QueryPayload` is sufficient — the field round-trips automatically through unmarshal → validate → marshal.
- `signoz_query_metrics` builds its payload internally via `BuildMetricsQueryPayloadJSON` (anonymous inline struct). Added `source string` param to that function rather than doing a post-build round-trip to avoid touching the validated JSON unnecessarily.
- `omitempty` tag is mandatory — existing round-trip tests must not regress, and omitting the field when empty matches the existing pattern for all optional fields in `QuerySpec` and siblings.
- No changes to `BuildMetricsQueryPayload` (non-JSON variant) since it returns `*QueryPayload` and callers can set `.Source` directly. Only the handler path via `BuildMetricsQueryPayloadJSON` needs the change.

## Open Questions
- [x] Does `signoz_execute_builder_query` need a new top-level parameter? **No** — user includes `source` inside each spec object; `QuerySpec.Source` captures it automatically through the typed round-trip.

### 2026-06-02 — Correction after live testing

Initial implementation placed `Source` on `QueryPayload` (top-level envelope). Live end-to-end testing against the SigNoz demo instance revealed the API rejected this with "unknown field source" — the field does not exist at the envelope level.

Inspection of the actual API payload (snapshot.py output) confirmed `source` is a sibling of `name` and `signal` inside the `spec` object of each `builder_query` entry in `compositeQuery.queries`.

Fix: moved `Source string json:"source,omitempty"` from `QueryPayload` to `QuerySpec`, and updated `BuildMetricsQueryPayloadJSON` to set `spec.Source = source` on each builder spec instead of the payload struct. The round-trip test was also corrected to assert the field at spec level.

Verified working after the fix:
- `signoz_list_metrics` with `source=meter` ✅ — returns all 6 Cost Meter metrics
- `signoz_execute_builder_query` with `"source":"meter"` inside spec ✅ — real data vs null without source
- `signoz_query_metrics` with `source=meter` ✅ — works including groupBy breakdowns

### 2026-06-08 — Review follow-up: direct test + agent-facing guide example

Review of the PR surfaced two gaps, both addressed here:

- **Test coverage.** The existing `TestQueryPayloadRoundTrip_PreservesSource` only exercises the `signoz_execute_builder_query` path (unmarshal → validate → marshal of a hand-written payload). The `signoz_query_metrics` path goes through `BuildMetricsQueryPayloadJSON` — the function that actually gained the `source` argument — and had no direct test. Added `TestBuildMetricsQueryPayloadJSON_AppliesSource`, asserting source lands on every `builder_query` spec, never on a `builder_formula` spec, and is omitted when empty.
- **Discoverability.** The `source` parameter was documented in the README param reference, but the `signoz://metrics-aggregation-guide` MCP resource (`pkg/metricsrules/guide.go`) — the agent-facing guide with payload examples — had no mention of Cost Meter. An agent reading it would never learn to set `source: "meter"`. Added a "Cost Meter (Telemetry Ingestion Volume)" section with the six real meter metric names/units (verified live via `signoz_list_metrics source=meter`: all delta monotonic sums) and a working example payload.

The six Cost Meter metrics (verified live): `signoz.meter.log.count`/`.size`, `signoz.meter.metric.datapoint.count`/`.size`, `signoz.meter.span.count`/`.size`.

### 2026-06-08 — E2E verification against staging + hourly-step caveat

Ran the guide's example payload against `app.us.staging.signoz.cloud` `POST /api/v5/query_range` (the exact path the MCP server uses):
- `source="meter"` + `signoz.meter.log.size` + `increase`/`sum` → real data (~55 MB/h log ingestion). `rate` variant also valid (~16 KB/s).
- Control without `source` → HTTP 200 but `"aggregations":null` — the same metric name returns nothing from the default store. Confirms `source` is load-bearing.

Step-interval sensitivity (this is the observed staging behavior; production/older versions may differ): the v5 endpoint **floors `stepInterval` to 3600 for meter queries** regardless of the requested value (every step of 60/300/1800/3600 returned identical hourly data with `"stepIntervals":{"A":3600}`). A query window under 1 hour returns a single current-hour bucket flagged `partial:true`, not an empty result. Documented this in the guide as a "Hourly aggregation — use `stepInterval: 3600`" subsection, noting that `signoz_query_metrics`'s auto-derived step (`max(60, window/300)`) is sub-hour for windows under ~12.5 days, so meter callers should set `stepInterval: 3600` explicitly.

### 2026-06-08 — Decision: no client-side step coercion; discoverability fixes

- **Q: Should the MCP server floor `stepInterval` to 3600 for meter queries (in `signoz_query_metrics` and/or `QueryPayload.Validate`)?** **Resolved: No.** The backend is the authority on its own rollup granularity and already floors the step (verified on staging); duplicating "meter = 3600" in the thin proxy is fragile coupling and silent rewriting of caller intent. If a backend version returns empty for sub-hour meter steps instead of flooring, that is a backend normalization issue, not something to paper over per-client. Keep it documentation-only (the guide's hourly subsection is caller guidance).
- **Discoverability gap closed.** `signoz_list_metrics` is the recommended first step (`signoz_query_metrics` tells the LLM to "call signoz_list_metrics first"), but its `source` param read only "Filter by source (optional)" — blind to `meter`. Updated the `source` description on `signoz_list_metrics` (and README param ref) to name `"meter"`, mirroring `signoz_query_metrics`. Added a sentence to the guide's Cost Meter intro clarifying that log/span/datapoint volume is queried as metrics (`signal: "metrics"`, `source: "meter"`), not via the logs/traces tools.
- **Tools are otherwise sufficient** to query Cost Meter: `signoz_list_metrics` (discover) → `signoz_query_metrics` / `signoz_execute_builder_query` (query), all `source`-aware. Issue #176 Gaps 2 & 3 (`signoz_get_metrics_stats`, `signoz_get_metric_attributes`) are adjacent metrics-introspection tools, not required for meter querying.

### 2026-06-08 — E2E verification of signoz_list_metrics for meter (staging)

Verified the `signoz_list_metrics` path directly against staging (`GET /api/v2/metrics`, the exact endpoint the tool builds):
- `?source=meter` → HTTP 200, returns the current 6 meter metrics with type/temporality/unit.
- Control without `source` (`searchText=signoz.meter`) → 0 results — meter metrics are invisible in the default store, confirming `source=meter` is required for discovery.

### 2026-06-08 — Concept correction + drop hardcoded metric list

- **"Cost Meter" is broader than telemetry ingestion volume.** It's the store for the metrics SigNoz *meters/bills on*; ingestion volume is today's content, but the name is deliberately general and the set will grow (e.g. AI credit usage). Reframed the guide section heading ("Cost Meter (SigNoz usage / billing metrics)") and intro, and softened the `signoz_list_metrics` `source` param description (tool + README) so it no longer equates meter with ingestion volume.
- **Q: Should the guide enumerate all meter metric names (they're fetchable live via `signoz_list_metrics`)?** **Resolved: No.** The set is live-queryable and evolving, so a hardcoded table (especially a `unit` column) is a staleness trap — it already went stale once (span units read `—` from an earlier instance; staging reports `1`/`By`). Replaced the fixed "Available Cost Meter metrics" table with a "Discover the current meter metrics" subsection that tells the agent to call `signoz_list_metrics source=meter` for the authoritative set + types/units, keeping only a few metrics as illustrative (explicitly "as of this writing"). The per-type aggregation guidance (counters → rate/increase + sum) is framed as applying to the current ingestion metrics, not assumed for future meter metrics.

### 2026-06-08 — Cost Meter across alerts, views, dashboards (E2E-verified via subagents)

Confirmed the MCP can create Cost Meter **alerts, saved views, and dashboards** — all three carry `source: "meter"` through to the backend, E2E-verified against staging by subagents (each created → confirmed server-side round-trip → deleted → confirmed gone; refs: [Cost Meter alerts docs](https://signoz.io/docs/cost-meter/alerts/), [alert configuration guide](https://signoz.io/docs/cost-meter/alert-configuration-guide/)):
- **Alerts** (`signoz_create_alert`): `validateAlertPayload` → `alert.ValidateFromMap` operates on `map[string]any` (no typed round-trip), so `source` + cumulative `evaluation` survive. Verified payload: METRIC_BASED_ALERT / threshold_rule, builder spec `source:"meter"` + `timeAggregation:"increase"`, threshold `matchType:"in_total"`, `evaluation.kind:"cumulative"` with `spec.schedule.type:"daily"`. Created 201, round-tripped, deleted 204/re-GET 404.
- **Saved views** (`signoz_create_view`): body marshaled verbatim (`marshalViewBody`); `validateBuilderSignal` only checks `signal==sourcePage`. A meter view is a `metrics`-page v5 view with `spec.source:"meter"`. Created 200, `spec.source=="meter"` preserved, deleted (note: GET on a deleted view returns 500, not 404).
- **Dashboards** (`signoz_create_dashboard`): panel `queryData` is `[]map[string]any` and `pkg/types/dashboard.go` already has `Source string json:"source,omitempty"` on the queryData entry; the panel validator (`panel_validator.go:672`) explicitly whitelists `source ∈ {"", "meter"}`. Dashboard panels use the v4 `query.builder.queryData[].source` shape (not the v5 compositeQuery spec). Created 201, `queryData[0].source=="meter"` preserved, deleted 204/re-GET 404.

Decisions/edits this round:
- **No client-side coercion** anywhere — backend owns the schema; the MCP paths are passthroughs.
- Added Cost Meter discoverability across the resources: alert resources get a `source` line in the builder-query spec section, a "Cumulative window (Cost Meter spend budgets)" subsection in Evaluation, and Example 11 (`metric_cost_meter`) in `signoz://alert/examples`. Saved-view instructions extend the existing `source` field row to name `"meter"` (metrics views only). The dashboard query-builder guide gets a short "Cost Meter (usage/billing metrics)" note under Metrics-Specific Features. Kept these brief (no full view/dashboard example payloads) per the concise-docs preference.
- New CLAUDE.md convention: live-instance E2E verification should be delegated to a subagent (clean up, never print creds, report round-tripped fields, copy existing shapes).

### 2026-06-08 — Codex (gpt-5.5/xhigh) review fixes + cumulative decoupled from Cost Meter

Codex review surfaced one blocking item and several should-fix/nits; applied them (plus the optional guards):
- **BLOCKING — alert input schema didn't model cumulative.** `signoz_create_alert`/`update_alert` use `mcp.WithInputSchema[types.CreateAlertInput]`, and `AlertEvaluation` advertised "only rolling" with `evalWindow` required and no schedule/timezone — contradicting the cumulative example/docs. Fixed `pkg/types/alertrule.go`: `AlertEvaluationSpec` now has optional `EvalWindow` + `Schedule (*AlertEvaluationSchedule{type,minute,hour})` + `Timezone`; `Kind` description covers rolling+cumulative. These types are schema-only (handler uses map passthrough), so no runtime payload change.
- **Cumulative is NOT Cost Meter-specific.** `evaluation.kind` is rule-level and orthogonal to the query-level `source`. E2E-proven both directions on staging via subagents: a rolling+meter rule already exists, and a cumulative alert on an ordinary metric (`signoz_calls_total`, no `source`) was created (201), round-tripped, and deleted (204/404). Decoupled the docs — `AlertEvaluation`/Evaluation-field descriptions and the alert-resource subsection ("Cumulative window (daily/monthly totals)") now present cumulative as general (any period-total alert), with Cost Meter spend as one example.
- **Guards added** (per request): reject `source:"meter"` unless signal/dataSource is metrics — in the alert validator (`pkg/alert/validate.go`) and dashboard panel validator (`panel_validator.go`), with negative+positive unit tests in both.
- **Doc/test nits:** corrected the guide's stepInterval attribution (the tool omits stepInterval; the *backend* derives it), version-scoped the partial-vs-no-data note; added `stepInterval: 3600` to Example 11; "Ten canonical" → "canonical … plus a Cost Meter example" (alerts.go + README); strengthened `TestBuildMetricsQueryPayloadJSON_AppliesSource` (two builder queries + explicit empty-source assertion); added a schema description to the nested alert-query `source`.

### 2026-06-08 — Codex follow-up review fixes (post-push)

The pushes re-triggered Codex; two new valid findings (the older inline comments were already addressed/stale):
- **Evaluation validation hole (my regression).** Making `AlertEvaluationSpec.EvalWindow` `omitempty` (to allow cumulative) removed the only signal that a *rolling* window needs `evalWindow`, and the map validator never checked evaluation-spec internals — so a rolling block without `evalWindow` (or a cumulative block without `schedule`) passed the MCP and failed at the SigNoz API. Added `validateEvaluation` in `pkg/alert/validate.go`: when an `evaluation` block is supplied (non-anomaly), require `evalWindow` for kind=rolling, `schedule` (type daily/monthly) for kind=cumulative, and reject empty/unknown kinds. Omitted evaluation still auto-defaults to rolling. Four unit tests added.
- **Manifest sync.** Per the CLAUDE.md doc-sync checklist, enriched `signoz_list_metrics` and `signoz_query_metrics` descriptions in `manifest.json` to mention `source="meter"` (Cost Meter), so manifest-consuming catalogs surface the capability.

Replied to the two Codex inline comments on the PR confirming the fixes.

### 2026-06-08 — Second Codex (gpt-5.5/xhigh) review pass + meter-step E2E

A fresh xhigh review (and a new PR inline comment) surfaced these; applied the valid set:
- **`frequency` now required** in `validateEvaluation` for both rolling and cumulative (it was only auto-supplied when the whole block was omitted; the schema marks it required).
- **Alert `source` validation hardened** to mirror the dashboard validator: reject any non-empty `source` other than `"meter"`, then enforce `"meter"` only with `signal:"metrics"` (previously only the meter+non-metrics case errored, so `source:"foo"` slipped through).
- **`AlertEvaluationSchedule.type` marked `jsonschema:"required"`**, and `validateEvaluation` now range-checks `minute` (0-59) / `hour` (0-23).
- **anomaly_rule now rejects a supplied `evaluation` block** (v1 anomaly uses top-level evalWindow/frequency; a stray evaluation previously passed through).
- **Decoupled** the builder-spec `source` doc line from cumulative (it had said "Pair with a cumulative evaluation window"); fixed the stale "ten canonical examples" wording in the alert instructions/examples resource. Added 5 unit tests; new `floatVal` helper.

- **Meter-step auto-flooring (re-raised by Codex) — declined again, now with E2E evidence.** Subagent test against staging: a `source=meter` query with **no `stepInterval`** (the `signoz_query_metrics` default path) returns a complete, usable series over a normal 24h window — the backend auto-floors to a 1h step (25 buckets, only edge buckets `partial`). Only a sub-hour *window* degrades to a single partial bucket. So client-side step coercion is **not** needed; the doc guidance covers the sub-hour caveat. Replied on the PR declining, per the standing no-coercion decision.

### 2026-06-15 — CORRECTION: saved Cost Meter views use `sourcePage="meter"`, not `metrics`
The 2026-06-08 saved-view decision above — *"A meter view is a `metrics`-page v5 view with `spec.source:"meter"`"* — was **wrong** for saved views specifically, and is superseded. Issue [SigNoz/signoz-ai-assistant#325](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-ai-assistant/issues/325) found that the SigNoz product treats Cost Meter as a **distinct `sourcePage="meter"`** with its own Meter Explorer route; the Meter Explorer lists views via an exact-match `source_page = 'meter'` query, so a view filed under `metrics` is invisible there and mis-filed. The 2026-06-08 work verified the API *round-trips* `source_page="metrics" + spec.source="meter"` (true — free-text column) but not that it lands in the right Explorer list (it doesn't). Corrected encoding: `sourcePage="meter"`, builder spec `signal="metrics"` + `source="meter"`. Implementation tracked in `plans/meter-view-sourcepage.{context,plan}.md`. (This correction applies only to *saved views*; the query/alert/dashboard meter paths from 2026-06-08 are unaffected — those carry `source="meter"` on a metrics signal and never had a separate sourcePage.)
